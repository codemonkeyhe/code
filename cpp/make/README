makefile has a very stupid relation with tabs, all actions of every rule are identified by tabs ...... 
and No 4 spaces don't make a tab, only a tab makes a tab.
to check I use the command 
cat -e -t -v makefile_name

It shows the presence of tabs with ^I and line endings with $ both are vital



切换空格
set et 
set noet 
set et ?
